### What I would like to accomplish in Web Design?
 
* Hi there, my name is Naitik. I enrolled in this web design course to improve my web development skills. I am somewhat familiar with front-end languages, such as HTML and CSS. But I would really like to learn more about these languages to use them to design any kind of site layout. The second reason is that, when it comes to real-world work, platforms like Github and Git are becoming more and more popular. Therefore, I want to learn more about them.
